# Discord-Pi-Bot
The Discord Bot Pi-Bot that I created, I decided to make it open source and put the code here because I am no longer going to be actively working on it.
Note: I'm aware the role system doesn't work properly. If anyone cares and wants to fix it feel free to send it to me and ill change the code here.

Python Version: 3.6.5

Create the folders "autoassign". "lfg", and "roles" (without the quotation marks) inside the pi_bot folder (Github deleted them)

Required Libraries:
discord.py
random
os.path
sys
forex_python.bitcoin

Feel free to use any of the code as long as you credit me.
